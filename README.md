<p>
    Welcome to my software development project repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects I've completed in groups or alone during my university studies in Information Systems Engineering.
</p>
<p>The utilized programming languages are the following: C#, C, SQL, Javascript, Haskell, Wollok, Prolog, HTML, CSS.</p>

## 🚀 Projects

### <a href="https://github.com/damiangluk/proyectos_materias_utn/tree/main/2023/sistemas_operativos">Operating system with C on Linux<a>
The project consists of a system distributed in 5 modules connected by sockets to simulate the execution of processes of a real operating system.

### <a href="https://github.com/damiangluk/proyectos_materias_utn/tree/main/2023/gestion_de_datos">Database modeling and creation with SQL/T-SQL<a>
Simulation of data migration of an information system where data was normalized, business ideas were modeled, and a database was implemented.
Implementation of a star model, with its procedures and views, that can be used to obtain management indicators, scenario analysis and projection for decision-making.

### <a href="https://github.com/damiangluk/proyectos_materias_utn/tree/main/2022/paradigmas_de_programacion">OOP, Functional and Logical paradigm<a>
Development of the different programming paradigms through exercises and practical implementations, where I gained a deeper understanding of how each paradigm approaches problem-solving and software design.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

Throughout these projects, I've gained valuable insights in:

- Technologies such as C#, C, SQL, Javascript, Haskell, Wollok, Prolog, HTML, CSS.
- Complex problem-solving.
- Collaboration in development teams.
- OOP including polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, composition and abstraction.
- Functional and logical paradigm.
- Design patterns such as Singleton, Adapter, Strategy, Observer and State.
- Unit tests
